		<h1>Our Store Policies</h1>
		<h2>Returns</h2>
		<p>If we ship you the wrong item, or it was not functional, Retrofit Authority will assume shipping responsibilities to and from our location. If you decided against buying a particular item after receiving it, the item must be returned in unopened condition within 45 days and will be subject to a 10% restocking fee.  Items must not need reconditioning or repackaging upon return, or will be subject to refurbishing fees.  Any coupons offered on the original purchase will be forfeited upon return.  If the item is being exchanged for another item of equal or greater value, it will not be subject to restocking fees, but may still be subject to a refurbishing or repackaging fee if not in unopened condition. Cancellations of an order must be made before it ships.</p>
		<h2>Warranty</h2>
		<p>All products provided by Retrofit Authority will have a unique warranty process, and it will be up to the customer to fully read the warranty description for the particular product they are buying. In the event of a warranty claim on a product or service provided by Retrofit Authority, the customer is responsible for return shipping, but the new item will be sent out at Retrofit Authority's expense.  All warranties are non transferrable.  If the customer needs to have a replacement sent, Retrofit Authority may request to either have the original item disabled, or returned.  If the customer needs a replacement before sending in the original item, a core charge can be placed in order to expedite the process.  The core charge will be refunded as soon as the customer returns the original product, which needs to be received within 45 days.</p>
		<h2>Shipping</h2>
		<p>Packages ship via USPS and have an included $100 insurance.  If the customer requires more insurance, it must be purchased before the item ships.  Retrofit Authority will assume no liability in the event the shipping carrier damages the product.</p>
