		<h2>About us</h2>
		<p>Retrofit Authority is not just an online store- it's the source of anything a headlight retrofitting service or do-it-yourself'er could possibly need, including information, as well as an internal service-based company for those who do not wish to do things themselves. Retrofit Authority's top priority is customer service, not just making a sale. Our goal is to make everything about a retrofit more affordable and more reliable. Gone are the days of paying upwards of $400 for an unreliable halo kit- or several hundred for projectors out of a wrecked vehicle on eBay with no warranty (or any idea if it will fit your vehicle).  We are constantly adding new products, so if there's something you don't see- or would like to see, just contact us through email.</p>
		<h2>Our Story</h2>
		<p>Retrofit Authority had small beginnings as a partnership between two people, who started Covert Customs- a headlight retrofitting service, in fall of 2013. For the five years previous, headlight modding was only a hobby done by the pair.  It became increasingly apparent that at the rate they were receiving messages, it couldn't stay a hobby.  In November of 2013, a partnership under Covert Customs began- marked by a huge increase in business.  Unfortunately, one of the owners of the company, Wyatt Carter, lost his life in a car accident in April of 2014.  Wyatt had done most of the retrofitting work himself up until this point.  After finishing existing orders, much consideration was given as to whether or not to continue business.   It was ultimately decided that his work was not meant to end so abruptly, and that he would have liked to see what it has grown to be.  Since August 2014, Covert Customs has made vast improvements to the  infrastructure of the company through new shop equipment to increase the quality of the work that is done and the speed at which it can be shipped out to the customer.  After securing new agreements with suppliers, it was decided a website dedicated to supplying retrofit accessories could better serve customers who wanted to do things themselves- thus, Retrofit Authority was born in January of 2015.  There are websites that offer retrofit parts, but none that offer everything that a retrofit service or headlight enthusiast would want- all in one place.  Not only can Retrofit Authority supply the parts, they can also supply the knowledge through their years of retrofitting headlights themselves- while still offering a complete service through Covert Customs, or another approved retrofitting service through the list of certified vendors. </p>
